Utilizing Time Series Forecasting Strategies, lets compare air travel between the two major Chicago airports, O'Hare(ORD) and Midway(MDW), to identify which airport has more consistent on-time departures in order to help consumers make the most informed decisions when purchasing airline tickets at a given time in the year. 

Both of these Chicago airports serve domestic and international flights, as well as face the same unique weather conditions of the "Windy City." However, ORD has a significantly larger operation with close to 800 flights per day, in comparison to MDW's roughly 200 per day. As these are two large operations, with several domestic, international, and connecting flights in and out per day, it is crucial that flyers have an idea of the reliability that their flight will get them to their next destination on time.

Therefore, this project's objective is to identify which Chicago airport between ORD and MDW is the most reliable to deliver customers an on-time departures.
